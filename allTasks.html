        What’s an Interface? What’s the difference between interface and abstract class? Is it allowed in JavaScript?
        <br>
        <br>

        The limitation of an abstract class lies in the fact that a sub-class can only extend a single abstract class.
        Hence, multiple inheritance is found in Interfaces.

        Interfaces can have conrete methods just like abstract classes, but cannot have instance fields, only public,
        static, final fields.

        Am I correct when i conclude that the only difference lies in the fact that interfaces simply cannot have
        instance fields?

        Why do we need literal objects? And how does it differs than normal classes?
    <h1>Object Literal Notation</h1>
    Let’s explore some examples of what literal notation looks like, and how the process of creating objects may be
    streamlined by using constructors.

    Let’s say a dog walker wants to keep track of all dogs they walk
    <h1>Object Constructor Notation</h1>

    In constructor notation, we are creating the same dogs we created in literal notation above, by calling the
    constructor function with the “new” keyword.
    <h1> Methods and properties with object literal and constructor notation
    </h1>
    Objects in JavaScript have methods and properties, whether they are built with the constructor function or with the
    literal notation. In JavaScript, the keyword called ‘this’ is the object that “owns” the code. The value of this,
    when used in an object, is the object itself. Let’s see how to define them:
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    It essentially boils down to if we need multiple instances of our object or not; object defined with a constructor
    let us have multiple instances of that object. Object literals are basically singletons with variables that are all
    public.
